like button is working in gui but don't add the song to the liked songs

volume bar and progress bar didn't respond untill i click the play button first 
	and after clicking on it if we click on the most right of the bar it gives only 99% of the bar not 100% and when clicking on the middle it gets only 49% not 50% 	
		"Not a big deal but still a bug"

the time in the progress bar is not correct it goes about 1.666 secs a second it counts every minute as 100 count not 60

on clicking on the previous button while the song is in the middle it goes to the previous track not the same one but from the beginning like "Spotify"

shuffle doesn't work

repeate one works but the queue is repeating anyway "No repeate all option" 

queue is not working properly when i click on the song to play it's photo doens't appear in the current playing 

	delete works but on deleting the element playing now it doesn't disapear from the now Playing

	like doesn't work either the gui or in the liked songs 

	when having a song in the middle and clicking on another song it play's the new song but from the the same time of the previous song or from the same as i left it 

	on clicking on the name of the song it doesn't play it and goes to "FaceBook" so as the name of the artist

	duration it is correct in the beginning then on waiting it becomes wrong

there is a problem i cannot make a code for on the next/prev button after it ends there are 2 songs are playing in the background 
	i don't know if it is a bug or because of the slow of responding through cypress 
 
if you copy an password from any file and paste it to the password box it will give error message that the password is weak regardless the strengh of the copied password  ؟؟!!

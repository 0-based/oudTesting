# ðŸ“œ Login-SignUP Handwritten Report

- Sometimes, login doesn't correspond to in/valid input data just like it's disabled and I can't understand what causes this behaviour.

- Title above email field ("Email or Username") and it's permitted only for **emails**.

- January month gives error in sign-up process.

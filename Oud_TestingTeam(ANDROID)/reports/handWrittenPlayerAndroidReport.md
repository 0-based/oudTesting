- There is only **one track** in the playlist so most of the tests are not complete.

- There is no Like button.

- I couldn't test the shuffle or next or previous buttons fully.

- There is no queue and all it's dependants.

- There is no volume button or volume bar.

> other than that every test i made has passed.
